# face-talk
A prototype that leverages facial expressions to facilitate non-vocal communication.
This project is a prototype that can be extended to develop a full featured application to help people who cant communicate vocally or using sign language. 

It consists of an on screen prompter which has the english alphabet and user can select on screen letters to type, by just blinking their eyes.

Current code support only blink detection but you can see a list of planned features below.
